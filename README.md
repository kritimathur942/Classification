# Classification
There are topic divided python projects which have further step division in every code, I have used 4 libraries 3 of them being common python libraries, pandas, numpy and matplotlib and one very effectively used library in machine learning that is scikit learn. The data sets are available on keggle, hope these projects are helpful!
Note: if you are running these on google colab in the first logistic regression install matplotlib python library because otherwise while visualising it will throw error about "countourf"
